# Redirects

Redirects allow you to add dynamic routing to your sites.

## File redirects

This redirect type allows you serve specific content at a given path. 

This is useful to create environment files for your frontend apps to fetch, serving a different env file for each branch.

## Reverse proxy redirects

This allows you to proxy any path to an arbitrary url.

This is useful for migrating old sites progressively: you can configure some pages to display the old version of your site.
