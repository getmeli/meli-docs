## Why do you use PostHog

[PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) is an open source, privacy-friendly analytics platform that lets us evaluate how many people are using Meli and which version they have in production. In practice, your Meli installation sends a heartbeat once a day to our PostHog server. You may disable this feature by setting the `MELI_POSTHOG_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.
