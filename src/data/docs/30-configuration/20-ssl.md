# SSL

Meli is built on top of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). Hence, it natively supports automatic SSL certificate issuance and renewal. By default, it uses LetsEncrypt, but Meli can obtain SSL certificates from a certification authority (CA) using the ACME protocol.

## Test with Let'sEncrypt staging environment

Let's Ecnrypt production [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) leave small room for error. Hence, we recommend using their staging environment to start off. All you need to do is to set:

<div class="code-group">

```dotenv
MELI_ACME_SERVER=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

</div>

## Using a custom ACME server

If you want to use a custom another CA:

<div class="code-group">

```dotenv
# The URL to the ACME directory, here is an example 
MELI_ACME_SERVER=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# Optionaly, if using a private ACME server, you should specify:
MELI_ACME_CA_PATH=<path to the CA certificate in the Caddy container>
```

</div>
