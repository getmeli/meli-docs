The permission system in Meli is simple. In short:
- Organization owners have full rights on their organizations.
- Organization admins can manage everything in the organization except:
    - removing the organization owner
    - updating organization settings
- Sites are only visible to team members.
- In a team, only admins can create/delete sites
- Team members can manage everything about sites
